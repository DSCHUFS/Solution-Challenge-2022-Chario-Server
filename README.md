# Handycon
## Donate to charity

We have been trying to figure out the solutions for SDGs, and started to focus on the organizations trying their best towards these goals. Unfortunately, these organizations were having hard time managing the programs they offer due to lack of budget since covid-19. <br> <br> 
So we created our own Handycon, where you can donate to charity organizations according to your interest in sustainable development goals. 


## Project goal

Gather news from donation organizations in one place to make it easier for people to access the news, which keeps the users interested in these charities. We encourage users to participate in donations, charity organizations to promote themselves, and world to be a better place.
